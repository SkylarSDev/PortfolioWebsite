<p>I finally refreshed my site and added a blog so I can begin documenting gamedev stuff.</p>

<h3>Why a blog?</h3>
<p>Because I felt like it! I find that on Twitter and Patreon it feels improper to just post about whatever I'm up to, despite that kind-of being the point. I often use social media for advertising instead of just yapping away, so I found myself yearning for a space I could just word vomit. However, I still wanted to be able to help someone out there since a lot of what I cover is VERY underground and niche, so you won't be finding anything useful on most of this stuff anywhere. </p>

<h3>What to expect</h3>
<p>A LOT of unfinished, half-finished, or half-polished projects that all touch on a lot of similar things. I've found myself flying by the seat of my pants most of the time, so I live by "as long as you're doing something, you're progressing." The issue is, I struggle with working on just one thing unless I'm working for someone else. So I'm in a bit of project hop hell. Either way, I do my best to keep it interesting.</p>

<p>If any of that sounds interesting, stick around. I'll try to post regularly, but that might be optimistic. We'll see.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading. Let's see where this goes. ☆</p>
